## 🔍 Overview

LearnMorra is a platform that combines **creator portfolios**, **interactive simulations**, and **community discovery**. Creators, developers, and learners can showcase work, explore simulations, and connect with others in a vibrant community.

It’s partly in development mode, with some features labeled “Soon” or “Pause / Reset”. Example creator profiles, like Kristin Meyer, show stats and portfolio elements.
